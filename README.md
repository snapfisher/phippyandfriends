# ADO/AKS Lab - Phippy and Friends

This is a static copy of phippy and friends that was used to create the ADO/AKS lab for the Microsoft Reston Technology Center.  Most probably, you are looking for [Azure/phippyandfriends](https://github.com/Azure/phippyandfriends), which is from where this originated and is updated regularly.

This repo will not be updated unless we update the AKS lab
